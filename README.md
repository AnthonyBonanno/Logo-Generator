# Logo-Generator
An app that can create a small logo with text and colour.

## Description

This application is designed to generate an SVG file that looks like a simple logo image. You can create your own logo simply by inputting text into the prompts in your terminal.

To do this, please invoke the application by entering the following command into your terminal: node .\index.js


## What was the motivation?

Testing the code you've written is a major part of any software dev's workflow. This project has helped me understand how to perform tests on my code, and the usefulness it has in telling me why a test has passed or failed. If it has failed, the terminal shows what part of my code has an error.


## What problems does it solve?

Any user that's after a simple and short logo can achieve this through this application. For example, a freelance web developer may want to use this so that they don't have to pay a graphic designer for a simple logo for their projects.

However, it is limited in the shape, colours and text you can use for your logo. There are 3 choices for shapes, 3 choices for the colour of your text, and 3 choices for the colour of your shape. There are no other options to add to your logo.
